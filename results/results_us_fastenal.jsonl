Because of its non-stick properties and high heat resistance PTFE is used as a non-stick coating for frying pans and other cookware. It makes an excellent insulating material for electrical applications because of its non-conductivity. PTFE is non-reactive to numerous chemicals due to the chemical resistance of fluoropolymer bonds; making it effective in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive substances. PTFE reduces friction wear and energy efficiency of machinery. Because of its low friction PTFE is used in industrial applications where sliding action of parts is required such as with bearings gears slide plates etc. In these applications it delivers significantly better performance than nylon or acetal. 3M has taken this versatile compound through an extrusion process to create a thin film then paired the film with 3M's unique pressure sensitive adhesives to make these PTFE tapes.

The liner-side acrylate adhesive provides very high initial and final adhesion to a range of traditional and scratch-optimized auto paint systems. The adhesive on the non-liner side is designed for plastic and metal surfaces including polypropylene PP/EPDM and thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) commonly used on automotive trim and components. Both adhesives are formulated for high adhesive build. The viscoelastic foam core conforms well even to complex geometries.

It functions as an anti-stick or easy-release medium where pressure temperature changes and other factors may create a measure of adhesion. Applying 3M™ PTFE Film Tape 5490 can help improve surface movement eliminate squeaks and rattles and reduce machine noise. PTFE is chemical resistant and can be used as a temporary chemical barrier. The tape has a wide temperature use range from -65[DEG}F/-54[DEG}C to 500[DEG}F/260[DEG}C making it a suitable choice for a variety of applications.Recommended ApplicationsRoll-wrap for web processing belts and plates where sticky materials and inks may occurHigh temperature wire bundling and harnessingSqueak and noise reductionLining of chutes toughs and ductsShielding and protecting against chemicalsMold release for composite bondingWhat is PTFE?Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a synthetic material used in a variety of industries and applications to reduce the coefficient of friction. Because of its non-stick properties and high heat resistance PTFE is used as a non-stick coating for frying pans and other cookware. It makes an excellent insulating material for electrical applications because of its non-conductivity. PTFE is non-reactive to numerous chemicals due to the chemical resistance of fluoropolymer bonds; making it effective in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive substances. PTFE reduces friction wear and energy efficiency of machinery. Because of its low friction PTFE is used in industrial applications where sliding action of parts is required such as with bearings gears slide plates etc. In these applications it delivers significantly better performance than nylon or acetal. 3M has taken this versatile compound through an extrusion process to create a thin film then paired the film with 3M's unique pressure sensitive adhesives to make these PTFE tapes. Innovative high performance 3M PTFE tapes are reliable durable and reduce friction.
