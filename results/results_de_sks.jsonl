The 3M sliding tapes are available in various thicknesses and different adhesive systems.","color":null,"material":"UHMW polyethylene (ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene)","type":"rubber/resin adhesive","backing":"polyethylene carrier (UHMW polyethylene)","temperature":null,"widthOriginal":{"value":50.8,"unit":"mm"},"widthConverted":{"value":50.8,"unit":"millimeters"},"lengthOriginal":{"value":16.5,"unit":"m"},"lengthConverted":{"value":16.5,"unit":"meters"},"weightOriginal":null,"weightConverted":null,"thicknessOriginal":{"value":0.28,"unit":"mm"},"thicknessConverted":{"value":0.28,"unit":"millimeters"},"rawWithVatProductPrice":{"value":211.62,"currency":"EUR","unit":"meters","amount":16.5},"euroProductPrice":{"value":211.62,"currency":"EUR","unit":"meters","amount":16.5},"_missing":["ean","temperature","weightOriginal","weightConverted","color"],"_check":"ok","_confidence":90,"_url":"https://www.shop-sks.com/3M-5423-UHMW-Polyethylen-Gleitklebeband-50-8mmx16-5m-0-28mm-Gummi-Harz","_htmlUrl":"https://ffcloud.s3.amazonaws.com/visit/html/3wzkm5njv1.html","_status":"ok","_proxy":"none","_timestamp":"2025-08-22T05:04:35.476Z","eurPerSqm":252.46957766642808}
