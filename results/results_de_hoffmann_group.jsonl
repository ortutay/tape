Due to its thick carrier material, it is ideal for protection in areas where strong abrasion is expected, as well as for protection against sandblasting and pearl blasting. 472 withstands common solvents, but care should be taken not to use highly plasticized materials, ketones, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and esters. Recommended applications: demanding protection, splicing, and sealing purposes, corrosion barrier between metals. The thick carrier material provides robust protection and improved abrasion resistance. The aggressive rubber adhesive permanently adheres to various surfaces, even for outdoor applications. Due to the flexible carrier material, the PVC tape is ideal for curved and uneven surfaces. Thanks to its unique elongation properties, the tape adapts to uneven surfaces without detaching or retracting. Good solvent resistance ensures protection for applications and extends product lifespan for repairing and protecting a range of surfaces and materials.","color":"Black","material":"PVC","type":"Rubber","backing":"PVC","temperature":null,"dimensions":{"widthOriginal":{"value":76,"unit":"mm"},"widthConverted":{"value":76,"unit":"millimeters"},"lengthOriginal":{"value":33,"unit":"m"},"lengthConverted":{"value":33,"unit":"meters"},"weightOriginal":null,"weightConverted":null,"thicknessOriginal":{"value":0.26,"unit":"mm"},"thicknessConverted":{"value":0.26,"unit":"millimeters"}},"rawWithVatProductPrice":{"value":111.85,"currency":"EUR","unit":"unit","amount":1},"euroProductPrice":{"value":111.85,"currency":"EUR","unit":"unit","amount":1},"_missing":null,"_check":"ok","_confidence":95,"_url":"https://www.hoffmann-group.com/DE/de/hom/p/7000047483-","_htmlUrl":"https://ffcloud.s3.amazonaws.com/visit/html/rtid1yxfmm.html","_status":"ok","_proxy":"datacenter","_timestamp":"2025-08-20T22:26:56.874Z","eurPerSqm":44.59728867623604}
